# 📸 My Instagram Clone - React Native

This project is a **basic Instagram clone** built with **React Native**, aimed to showcase my skills in mobile development, UI design, and modern project structure.

## 🚀 Main Features

- 📷 Feed with posts (mock data + API)  
- ❤️ Simulated likes and comments  
- 💾 Save posts functionality  
- 🎛 Swipeable options modal  
- 👤 Dynamic avatars and usernames  
- 🧭 Bottom tab navigation  
- 🔍 Fullscreen image modal with zoom and swipe-to-close  

## 🌐 Responsive Web Support

- The main screen (`HomeScreen`) is designed so that on large screens (like web browsers or tablets) the content maintains a **maximum width of 420px**, similar to a large mobile phone.  
- This allows the app to be centered and maintain realistic proportions on any device, enhancing user experience and visual consistency.  
- A responsive container is used to achieve this adaptation without affecting the mobile experience.
